# Essay-Score-ENEM-2019 (EDA)

>> *The National High School Exam (Enem in portuguese) was instituted in 1998, with the objective of evaluating students' academic performance at the end of basic education. The exam improved its methodology and, in 2009, it started to be used as a mechanism of access to higher education, through the Unified Selection System (Sisu in portuguese), the University for All Program (ProUni in portuguese) and agreements with Portuguese institutions. The Enem participants can also apply for student financing in government programs, such as the Student Financing Fund (Fies in portuguese). The results of Enem continue to enable the development of studies and educational indicators.*

This project aims to analyze the performance of the participants in the essay, taking into account some of their characteristics. In this way, we intend to observe the relationship between the score of essay and some variables that represent characteristics of the participants.






QUESTIONS:

1) What is the relationship between essay score and age?
2) What is the relationship between the score of the essay and the race of the participant?
3) Is there a distinction between the average score of male and female participants?
4) What is the relationship between the level of education of those responsible and the essay score?
5) And how family income impacts the performance of participants.
